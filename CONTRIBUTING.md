If you're planning on implementing major changes, please [get in touch](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de) first. This project entailed my very first steps in more advanced javascript, so I'd also appreciate if you pointed out the weird parts in the code that require refactoring.

**To Do**:
- [ ] Search function for places
- [ ] iOS version
