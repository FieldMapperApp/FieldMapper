If you're planning on implementing major changes, please [get in touch](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de) first. This project entailed my very first steps in more advanced javascript, so I'd also appreciate if you pointed out the weird parts in the code that require refactoring.

To build the app, clone the repo and run `$ npm i && cordova prepare`.

**To Do**:
- [ ] Search function for places
- [ ] iOS version
