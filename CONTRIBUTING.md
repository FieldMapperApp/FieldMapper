If you're planning on implementing major changes, please [get in touch](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de) first. This project entailed my very first steps in more advanced javascript, so I'd also appreciate if you pointed out the weird parts in the code that require refactoring.

To build the app, install Node and Cordova, if you haven't already, clone the repo and run 
```
npm i
cordova prepare
mobileui install tab
mobileui install input
mobileui install header
mobileui install page
mobileui install font "Open+Sans:300"
```

**To Do**:
- [ ] Auto saving
- [ ] Images as attributes
- [ ] Custom colors
- [ ] Search function for places
- [ ] iOS version
