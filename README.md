# FieldMapper

FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in fieldwork settings. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you create features (= data points) with certain attributes on a map. The data can then be exported to GIS software and further processed according to your needs. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point features or freehand-drawn line features, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where spatially coded information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set.

Contributions to the project are most welcome.<sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> If you're planning on implementing major changes, please [get in touch](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de) first. 
If you think the app lacks an important feature or its scope should be broadened to render different [use cases](docs/use_cases.md) possible, I'd be happy to make this work. Also, if you encounter bugs or struggle with the usage of the app, just drop me a line. I'm also eager to hear from you if you have used the app in your project. Please provide reference to FieldMapper where possible.

This project entailed my first steps in more advanced javascript, so I appreciate if you point out the weird parts of the code that require refactoring.
