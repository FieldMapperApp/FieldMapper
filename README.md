# FieldMapper

FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered Android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in fieldwork contexts. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you create objects with user-generated attributes on a map. The data can then be exported into GIS software and further processed. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point objects or freehand-drawn line objects, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where place-specific information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set. On top of that, you can import your own layers and fine-tune the user experience with a variety of options.

[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project are most welcome. If you think the app lacks an important feature or its scope should be broadened to render different use cases possible, I'd be happy to make this work. Also, if you encounter bugs or struggle with the usage of the app, just [drop me a line](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de). I'm eager to hear from you if you have used the app in your project. Please provide reference to FieldMapper where possible.
