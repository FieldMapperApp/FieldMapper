# FieldMapper

FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in fieldwork settings. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you set up a number of variables and create data points with certain attributes on a map. The data can then be exported to GIS software and be visualised as a heat map, for instance. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point features or freehand-drawn line features, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where spatially coded information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set. FieldMapper does not necessarily require an internet connection as layers can be cached for offline use.
