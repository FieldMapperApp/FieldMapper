# FieldMapper

FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in fieldwork settings. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you create data points with certain attributes on a map. These features can be colored as desired, tagged with metadata and properties can be assigned to them. The data can then be exported to GIS software in GeoJSON format and be visualised as a heat map, for instance. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point features or freehand-drawn line features, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where spatially coded information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set.
