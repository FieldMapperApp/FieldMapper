# FieldMapper

FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in fieldwork settings. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you create objects with user-generated attributes on a map. The data can then be exported to GIS software and further processed according to your needs. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point objects or freehand-drawn line objects, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where spatially coded information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set. On top of that, you can import your own layers and fine-tune the user experience with a variety of options.

[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project are most welcome. If you think the app lacks an important feature or its scope should be broadened to render different [use cases](docs/use_cases.md) possible, I'd be happy to make this work. Also, if you encounter bugs or struggle with the usage of the app, just [drop me a line](mailto:felix-schott@gmx.de). I'm eager to hear from you if you have used the app in your project. Please provide reference to FieldMapper where possible.
